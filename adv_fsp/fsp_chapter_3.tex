\chapter{Logical Interfaces}\hypertarget{tsfi.ls}{\label{tsfi.ls}}

This chapter describes the logical interfaces of the TOE. There is a section for
each logical interface. These sections provide a graphical representation of the
protocols that are provided by the interface. In these depictions, the protocols
that are connected to a TSFI are marked orange. Dotted protocols are interfaces
to non-security functions of the TOE, thus \secitem{non-TSFI}. They are depicted
nevertheless, because they are part of the external interfaces of the TOE.

\hrefsection{tsfi.ls.led}{\tsfisectionname{ls.led}}

The TOE can display its operational status via this interface. \lsled{} is used
by the operating system. The meaning of the different color codes of the LEDs
are described in the administrator's guide \autocite[Section~6]{agd_adm}.
