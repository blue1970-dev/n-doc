\chapter{Introduction}
\label{intro}

This document contains the necessary information for the evaluation of the
security assurance component \secitem{ADV_FSP.4} for the evaluation of
\thisproduct{}. The document starts by describing the physical and logical
interfaces that concern the TSF, the security functions of the TOE. After that,
the security functions are described in detail. The documentation shows the
relationship between interfaces and security functions.

\chapter{Physical Interfaces}\label{tsfi.ps}

\hrefsection{tsfi.ps.lan}{\texorpdfstring{\formatintf{PS.LAN}}{PS.LAN}}

The TOE uses the interface \formatintf{PS.LAN} to communicate with other IT
products in the LAN. The interface is an ethernet interface in the form of a
RJ45 jack. The logical interface \lslan{} is provided via this
interface. Despite the TOE being a software TOE, the hardware plays an important
role for the TOE's security. For this reason, we examine the properties of the
physical interfaces provided by \thisproduct{}. Sinc ethe physical properties
are identical, the description holds for \formatintf{PS.LAN} as well as for
\formatintf{PS.WAN}.


\hrefsection{tsfi.ps.wan}{\texorpdfstring{\formatintf{PS.WAN}}{PS.WAN}}

This interface is analogous to the interface \formatintf{PS.LAN}. It is used to
communicate with other IT products in the WAN.

\hrefsection{tsfi.ps.led}{\texorpdfstring{\formatintf{PS.LED}}{PS.LED}}

The TOE's case has LEDs on the front side. The LEDs indicate the TOE's
operational status. The logical interface \lsled{} is provided via this physical
interface.
